    "The vulnerabilities presented are exclusively classic C-style memory safety and logic errors introduced into the NGINX codebase. The analysis reveals three dominant patterns:\n",
    "- New Feature Flaws: Every vulnerability is introduced while adding a new feature, highlighting the inherent risk of extending a complex, mature system.\n",
    "- Input Validation Failures: The vast majority of bugs stem from insufficient validation of user-controlled input, whether it's the input's size, format, or sequence.\n",
    "- Context-Dependent Complexity: Many vulnerabilities are simple to patch (often a one-line fix) but are rated as \"hard\" to discover. This difficulty arises from complex control flows, state management, and resource lifecycles, where the error's context is more critical than the code itself."

This requires multiple conditions to be met: a specific User-Agent and the presence of a Cookie header."
